# [Project 3 - Mail](https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/projects/3/mail/)

#### Description
This is a single page application for an email service.  Users can send and recieve emails, along with replying to and archiving them.  They can views their inbox, sent emails, and archived emails along with viewing each email.  It was implemented with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript only.  The app is a single page application, meaning only JavaScript is used to refresh the page.  An API to work with the emails was provided in the Django project.  I implemented the main [inbox.html](mail/templates/mail/inbox.html) page for this project, as well as the [CSS and JavaScript](mail/static/mail) files.
