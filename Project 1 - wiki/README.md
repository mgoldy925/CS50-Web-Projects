##### Description
This project recreates a simple wiki website.  Visitors can create and edit pages in GitHub markdown language.  Visitors can view all listings, search for wiki pages, or visit a random one.  It was implemented with a Django backend and HTML templates, but with little CSS.  For this project, I implemented almost all of [views.py](/encyclopedia/views.py) and [urls.py](/encyclopedia/urls.py) aside from some simple starter code, along with all of the templates except for most of [layout.html](/encyclopedia/templates/encyclopedia/layout.html), and also half of [styles.css](/encyclopedia/static/encyclopedia/styles.css).
