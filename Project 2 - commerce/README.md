# [Project 2 - Commerce](https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/projects/2/commerce/)

##### Description
This project web app models a sample eBay website.  Visitors can view active listings as well as all listings by category.  Listing pages feature various information about the item, including a picture, as well as the ability for users to comment, bid, and add/remove the item to/from their watchlist.  Sellers can close their listings, at which point the winner is shown and the winning user can see that they won.  It was implemented with a Django backend using models for the various information in the website along with HTML templates.  For this project, I implemented almost all of [views.py](auctions/views.py), [urls.py](auctions/urls.py), and [models.py](auctions/models.py) aside from some simple starter code.  I also created all of the templates except for most of the layout page and the login and register pages.
