# [Project 0 - Search](https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/projects/0)

##### Description
This project emulates the Google search pages for regular, image, and advanced search, entirely through HTML and CSS by making GET queries to Google.  It encorporates an I'm Feeling Lucky option for the regular search, and the styling of each page resembles that of the actual Google pages.  For this project, I created every file except for some simple starter code provided in [index.html](index.html) and the picture of the Google logo.  **A demonstration of my project can be found [here](https://youtu.be/iLfOyNap1KU).**
