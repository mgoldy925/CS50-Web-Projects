# Project 0 - Search

This project emulates the Google search pages for regular, image, and advanced search, entirely through HTML and CSS.  
For this assignment, I created all the files except for some simple starter code provided in [index.html](index.html) (and the picture of the Google logo, that is from online).  
The CS50 Web assignment page for this project can be found [here](https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/projects/0/search/), and a demonstration of my project can be found [here](https://youtu.be/iLfOyNap1KU).
